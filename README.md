# Project Golf It!

## Installation

- `npm or yarn install`
- `npm or yarn start`
- [Go here](http://localhost:3000)

## Context

Project Golf It! is a 2D representation of the well-known game Golf It!. We used **p5.js** for the game and front-end and **NodeJS**, **Express**, and **socket.io** for the server and the multiplayer. 

Two people ore more can play together and see each other balls. The goal is to achieve the holes with the less points.

## Difficulties

Due to the time, we were not able to get a proper database and scoreboard. Also the multiplayer was very hard to add because of the collisions with the walls and the ball position.
